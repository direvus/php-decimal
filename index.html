<p>An arbitrary-precision decimal library for PHP.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/direvus/php-decimal">https://github.com/direvus/php-decimal</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="background" class="anchor" href="#background"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>The PHP language only offers two numeric data types: <em>int</em> and <em>float</em>.
Neither of these types are suitable for a substantial set of real-world
problems, where exact arithmetic with values of arbitrary precision are
required -- notably, when working with monetary values.</p>

<p>PHP's optional extension <a href="http://au2.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php">BCMath</a> provides some limited features in this
area, but it is awkward to use when precision is variable, and it does not
support rounding.</p>

<p>This library uses the BCMath functions internally, but hides them behind a more
convenient, object-oriented, and intuitive API.</p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Copy the library file 'decimal.php' to anywhere on your system you like.
Personally I recommend something like <code>/usr/local/lib/php-decimal</code>, but it's
totally up to you.</p>

<p>In your PHP code, execute <code>include '/path/to/lib/decimal.php';</code> and you're
ready to use the library.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<p>One classic example of how binary floating-point values can ruin your day is
the expression (0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3), which is of course equal to zero.
Let's use this as a worked example.  First, using PHP's built-in float data
type:</p>

<pre><code>php &gt; $n = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3;
php &gt; var_dump($n);
float(5.5511151231258E-17)

php &gt; var_dump($n == 0);
bool(false)
</code></pre>

<p>Unless you want to do all your comparisons using an epsilon value, binary
floating-point is exactly this kind of trouble waiting to happen.  The next
most obvious place to turn is the BCMath extension, which would look like:</p>

<pre><code>php &gt; bcscale(1);
php &gt; $n = bcsub(bcadd(bcadd('0.1', '0.1'), '0.1'), '0.3');
php &gt; var_dump($n);
string(3) "0.0"

php &gt; var_dump(bccomp($n, 0) == 0);
bool(true)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we're at least getting the right answer, but the code is an unreadable
mess, and it gets worse if you don't know ahead of time what the precision of
your inputs is going to be, and therefore can't choose a global value for
bcscale that will be appropriate for all circumstances.</p>

<p>Enter php-decimal:</p>

<pre><code>php &gt; include '/path/to/lib/decimal.php';

php &gt; $n = new Decimal\Decimal;
php &gt; $n-&gt;increase('0.1', '0.1', '0.1', '-0.3');
php &gt; var_dump((string) $n);
string(1) "0"

php &gt; var_dump($n-&gt;zero());
bool(true)
</code></pre>

<p>We didn't have to lock php-decimal into any particular precision for its
computations; it noticed that all its operands had a scale of 1, so it told
BCMath to performs its operations at scale 1.  If any of the operands had had a
greater scale, then we would have used that scale instead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as PHP does not offer any way to hook into its built-in
comparison and arithmetic operators, it isn't possible to use natural syntax
like <code>$c = $a + $b</code>, where <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> are Decimal objects.  We have to make
do with relatively ugly method calls.</p>

<h2>
<a name="internals" class="anchor" href="#internals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internals</h2>

<p>Each instance of the Decimal class consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a sequence of decimal digits stored as a PHP string,</li>
<li>an integer exponent, and</li>
<li>a boolean indicating whether the number is negative.</li>
</ul><p>Each Decimal value represents the real number <em>n</em> such that:</p>

<pre><code>n = [-]digits × (10 ^ exponent)
</code></pre>

<p>The number 7500 would be therefore represented internally by the values
<code>('75', 2, false)</code>, respectively, as 7500 = 75 × 10^2.</p>

<p>It can be seen that, for every real number which has a finite representation in
decimal form, there are infinitely many possible Decimal representations, but
only one representation which uses the minimal number of decimal digits, which
is called the 'normal' or 'canonical' representation.</p>

<p>Decimals can be initialised from other Decimal instances, strings describing
numbers, integers and floats (with the caveat that if you initialise from a
float you might end up exposing yourself to precisely the kind of mischief this
library was created to avoid).</p>

<p>In terms of performance, this library is probably pretty awful and should
really only be used as a last resort.  If at all possible, perform all
computations in your database or in some other programming environment, and
leave PHP blissfully agnostic of difficult problems like basic arithmetic.</p>

<h2>
<a name="standards" class="anchor" href="#standards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Standards</h2>

<p>This library has some superficial resemblances to the IEEE 854 and 754
standards, but does not comply, nor does it attempt to comply, with these
standards.  It would be possible to extend the library into compliance, but at
this time the author has no intention of doing so.</p>

<p>In particular, php-decimal does not attempt to represent abstract numeric
concepts like NaN ("Not a Number"), infinity or negative infinity.</p>

<a name="license" class="anchor" href="#license"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>License</h2>

<p>php-decimal is released under the "BSD 2-clause license", the full text of

<h2>
<a name="author" class="anchor" href="#author"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Author</h2>

<p>php-decimal was written by Brendan Jurd, in a fit of pique after PHP munged his
numbers in early 2014.</p>
